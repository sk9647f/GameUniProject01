Minimap project folder, needs unzipping. 
Main camera and brought up camera switch being active when "m" is pressed. This is to simulate some way of bringing up a more full screen map.
Minimap in corner follows one of the sprites and directly renders onto a side texture. This is done through using a render texture placed onto a raw image within the canvas
Unsure if its my PC but framerate issues start to occur when running, may be due to the use of 3 cameras or the render texture.

Minimap camera has a camera culling mask for a new minimap layer. Main camera has a culling mask for everything but the new minimap layer
Small objects/sprites can be placed into the minimap layer to represent the physical objects (Minimap icons can be added)

Notes - 
Adding the code to the scene placed in adjacent branch (Fixed)
Having issues disabling the render texture at correct times  (Fixed)


Shop Project folder, needs unzipping-
Shop takes an item from one side and moves it to the other and dynamically moves the ui around. 
Shop can have items changed via the Unity editor. On the panel, the viewport, content, in the shop script the length of the array can be increased/decreased.
As the array changes size the number of active instances increases and allows for customizable items to be placed into the shop.

Notes - 
Shop ui will need to be messed around with to show proper sizes.
Left shop will need to be the player's inventory, so the items are taken from an inventory array that will be saved to the character.
