Minimap project folder, needs unzipping. 
Main camera and brought up camera switch being active when "m" is pressed. This is to simulate some way of bringing up a more full screen map.
Minimap in corner follows one of the sprites and directly renders onto a side texture. This is done through using a render texture placed onto a raw image within the canvas
Unsure if its my PC but framerate issues start to occur when running, may be due to the use of 3 cameras or the render texture.

Edit - Adding the code to the scene placed in adjacent branch
